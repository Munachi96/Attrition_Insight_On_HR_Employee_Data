##  Data Source:
HR Employee Data : this is the primary dataset used for this data analysis project. it contains detailed information about each employee in the company or previous employee. this information was extracted from the company's data in an excel format.

##  Data Analysis Tools Used:
   -   Power BI
   -   data modelling <br> <br>
   -   data Analysis <br> <br>
   -   Data Visualization and creating an interactive report <br> <br>

##  Data Collection : 
   -  the data was extracted from an excel format saved as a CSV file for the purpose of this analysis.

##  Data Cleaning/Formatting :
  - I used power query to clean and transform the data to the required standard needed for the analysis.

##  Loading Data into Power BI :
   - I loaded the transformed data into Power BI for the visualization to create an interactive dashboard report.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) : 
  EDA involves exploring the HR employee data in order to answer some key qustion such as :<br> <br>
  - what are the top 2 educational fields by attrition count ?<br> <br>
  - what educational fields has the lowest attrition count   ? <br> <br>
  - what are the top 2 educational fileds by attrition rate by ranking ? <br> <br>
  - which gender has the highest attrition count ? <br> <br>
  - what age group has the most attrition count ? <br> <br>
  - which department has the highest attrition count ? <br> <br>

## Result/Finding : my result and finding are summarized as follows :
 1 .     the top 2 educational fields by attrition are :  <br> <br>
      - life science : with a total of 89 attrition count 38 females and 51 males out of the 606 employee count with a percentage of 14.6%,
        life science currently has a total of 517 active employees.  <br> <br>
      - Medical : with a total of 63 attrition count 44 males and 19 females out of the 464 employee count with a percentage of 13.58%,

 2 .   the educational field with the lowest attrition :
       - HR : with a total 7 attrition count, 3 females and 4 males out of the 27 employee count with a percentage of 25.93%, Hr currently has a total of 20 active employee  br> <br>

 3 .  the educational field with the highest attrition rate :
       - HR by 25.93 %
       - Technical 24.24%

  4 . gender : with the highest Attrition count (Male) by 150 count

  5 . the department with the highest Attrition count : R & D Deaprtment by 133 count

## Recomendation : 
  1. the management should get a feedback from the department that experience attrition and narrow down a reason to gain deeper insight  <br> <br>
  2. the Management should investigate why the age group left and get a feedback   <br> <br>
  3. the management should implent team bonding session to improve work life balance   <br> <br>
  4. the management should investigate the reason for the male attrition  
          <br> <br>
